\section Intro
Hello World

\section Getting Started
This is a quick guide of how to use the different components of the finite state machine. <br/>

	\subsection Setting up States
	To get started with states, you have to define a new C++ class that is (derived from) <b>State</b>. <br/>

	\code{.cpp}
	class YourState : State
	{
		// TODO: X
	};
	\endcode


	\subsection Running the State Machine
	Has to be defined in main.cpp
